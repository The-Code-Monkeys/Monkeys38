# Boolean Algebra Laws

As you can see from the table above, most of the boolean laws are the basic mathematical operations that you are probably familiar with. However, there are a few of these laws that are especially important and are ones that College Board wants you to know for the exam, such as De Morgan's law. 


## Practice Problems for Boolean Algebra

Using the table above, write the equivalent form of the expression given or prove that a statement is true where indicated. 

Note for that these practice problems, the * symbol represents multiplication and that the single apostrophe acts as the "not" symbol (the bar you see over the terms in the table above).

What is the expression ```((W+X+Y)*Z)'``` equivalent to? 

What is the expression ```(ABC+XYZ)'``` equivalent to?

What is the expression ```((X+(YZ)'))'``` equivalent to?

Prove the following: ```(A*(A+B)) + (B'+(AB)) = B'+ A``.
