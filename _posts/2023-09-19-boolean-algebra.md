# Boolean Algebra Laws

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/booleanalgebralaws.png"  width="800" height="450" />

As you can see from the table above, most of the boolean laws are the basic mathematical operations that you have learned early on. However, there are a few of these laws that are especially important and are ones that College Board wants you to know for the exam. 

Below are the main laws that College Board wants you to know:  

- De Morgan's Law
- Absorption Law
- Annulment Law



## Practice Problems for Boolean Algebra


Note for that these practice problems, the * symbol represents multiplication and that the single apostrophe acts as the "not" symbol (the bar you see over the terms in the table above).

What is the expression ```((W+X+Y)*Z)'``` equivalent to? 

What is the expression ```(ABC+XYZ)'``` equivalent to?

What is the expression ```((X+(YZ)'))'``` equivalent to?

Prove the following: ```(A*(A+B)) = 1``.
